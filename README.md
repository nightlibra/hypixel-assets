# Project Information
This project provides the following:
1. Patched versions of each Hypixel resource pack, fully compatible with the latest Minecraft versions.
2. A single world containing various Hypixel maps, for simple exploration between them. It also provides various tools for the development and debugging of the aforementioned resource packs.

The original goal of this project was to patch the Turbo Kart Racers resource pack for 1.21.5+, as the official version is, quite literally, half broken. From there, I decided to also patch the Smash Heroes resource pack as a few key textures are broken in its official version too. During that, the project scope expanded significantly when I discovered the Hypixel Map Archive, and subsequently decided to shove as many maps as possible into a single world to make exploration simple.
